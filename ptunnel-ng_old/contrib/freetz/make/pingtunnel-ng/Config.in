		Ptunnel-NG is an application that allows you to reliably tunnel TCP
		connections to a remote host using ICMP echo request and reply packets,
		commonly known as ping requests and replies. At first glance, this might
		seem like a rather useless thing to do, but it can actually come in
		handy in some cases. This is the [N]ew [G]eneration fork of PingTunnel!
