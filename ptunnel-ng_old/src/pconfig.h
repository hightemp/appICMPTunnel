     * - The seq-no of the ping packet is used in a sliding-window-esque
     * way, and to identify the order of data.
     *
     * The protocol can be in any of the following states:
     * kProxy_start        Causes the proxy to open a connection to the given
     *                     host and port, associating the ID with the socket,
     *                     before the data on the socket are transmitted.
     * kProxy_data     Indicates that the packet contains data from the proxy.
     *                     Data ordering is indicated by the seq-no, which will start
     *                     at 0. (The proxy and forwarder maintain different seq-nos.)
     * kUser_data      This packet contains user data.
     * kConnection_close   Indicates that the connection is being closed.
     * kProxy_ack and      Acknowledges the packet (and all packets before it) with seq_no = ack.
     * kUser_ack       This is used if there are no implicit acknowledgements due to data
     *                     being sent.
     *
     * Acknowledgements work by the remote peer acknowledging the last
     * continuous seq no it has received.
     *
     * Note: A proxy receiving a kProxy_data packet, or a user receiving a
     * kUser_data packet, should ignore it, as it is the host operating system
     * actually returning the ping. This is mostly relevant for users, and for
     * proxies running in unprivileged mode.
