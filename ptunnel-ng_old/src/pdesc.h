/** forward_desc_t: Describes a piece of that needs to be forwarded. This

 * forwarding over TCP:
 *
 * 1. Client sends data to proxy over ICMP
 * 2. Proxy receives the data, and puts it into a forward_desc_t
 * 3. The proxy starts send()-ing the data over the TCP socket to the destination,
 *    decreasing forward_desc_t->remaining with the number of bytes transferred.
 * 4. Once remaining reaches 0, the forward_desc_t is removed from the receive
 *    ring.
 *
 * The same procedure is followed in proxy-to-client communication. Just replace
 * proxy with client and vice versa in the list above.
